# 42-Libft
This is my own c library, with my own functions.

Summary
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we’ll be allowed to use in all the other (future) projects.

Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. The objective is to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.

General Instructions
Create the functions in the order you believe makes most sense.
Write in accordance with the Norm.
Write a functional project: avoid unexpectedly quit (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors.
All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary.
Submit a file named author containing your username followed by a ’\n’ at the root of your repository,
Submit a C file for each function you create, as well as a libft.h file, which will contain all the necessary prototypes as well as macros and typedefs you might need. All those files must be at the root of your repository.
Submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to a static library libft.a.
The Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean et re in the order that you will see fit.
The Makefile must compile your work with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror.
Only the following libc functions are allowed : malloc(3), free(3) and write(2), and their usage is restricted, include the necessary include system files to use one or more of the three authorized functions in the .c files.
The only additional system include file you are allowed to use is string.h to have access to the constant NULL and to the type size_t. Everything else if forbidden.
We can create test programs for this library, but don't have to be submitted.
The above instructions and the following requested functions were included in the project libft.

[Instructions will be completed..]
